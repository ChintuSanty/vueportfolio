      I have been in IT since 2012, working in different roles and technologies. I have built web pages and web apps using multiple technologies. I like learning new technologies and working with them on real-time projects. I'm into gaming and love to play games on all types of consoles. I'm fond of gadgets. My hobbies are swimming, reading comics/manga and watching anime.
